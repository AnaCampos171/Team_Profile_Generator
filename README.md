```
node index.js
```

## Usage
- User is presented with a CLI app that accepts user input when running node index.js( npm start)
- When the user starts the application, they are prompted to enter the team member's name, role, and other options related to their role.
- WHEN the user decides to finish building their team, they can choose to end the app and the HTML page will be generated.
